# CHAPTER 1: NETWORK INTERFACES
echo "=== CHAPTER 1: NETURING NETWORK INTERFACES ==="
echo "Let's start by learning how to view and configure network interfaces."
echo ""

# Step 1: View network interfaces
echo "Step 1: First, let's see the available network interfaces on your system. Use the 'ip addr show' or 'ifconfig' command."
echo "The 'ip addr show' command displays information about all network interfaces, including their IP addresses and status."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "ip addr show"
echo ""
echo "You should see a list of network interfaces (e.g., eth0, wlan0). Each interface has an IP address and other details."
echo ""

# Step 2: Check the status of a specific interface
echo "Step 2: Now let's check the status of a specific interface. Use the 'ip link show <interface>' command, replacing <interface> with the name of your interface (e.g., eth0)."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "ip link show"
echo ""
echo "This command shows whether the interface is UP (active) or DOWN (inactive)."
echo ""

# Step 3: Bring an interface up or down
echo "Step 3: Let's learn how to bring a network interface up or down. Use the 'ip link set <interface> up' or 'ip link set <interface> down' command."
echo "For example, to bring 'eth0' up, you would use: 'ip link set eth0 up'."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "ip link set eth0 up"
echo ""
echo "If the command succeeds, the interface should now be active. You can verify this by running 'ip link show <interface>' again."

# CHAPTER 2: NETWORK ROUTES
clear
echo "=== CHAPTER 2: CONFIGURING NETWORK ROUTES ==="
echo "Now let's learn how to view and configure network routes."
echo ""

# Step 4: View the routing table
echo "Step 4: First, let's view the current routing table. Use the 'ip route show' command."
echo "The routing table shows how traffic is directed between networks."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "ip route show"
echo ""
echo "You should see a list of routes, including the default gateway and any specific routes for your network."
echo ""

# Step 5: Add a static route
echo "Step 5: Now let's add a static route. Use the 'ip route add' command. For example, to add a route to the network 192.168.2.0/24 via gateway 192.168.1.1, use:"
echo "'ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1'."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1"
echo ""
echo "The route has been added. You can verify it by running 'ip route show' again."
echo ""

# Step 6: Delete a static route
echo "Step 6: To delete a route, use the 'ip route del' command. For example, to delete the route we just added, use:"
echo "'ip route del 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1'."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "ip route del 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1"
echo ""
echo "The route has been removed. Verify this by running 'ip route show' again."

# CHAPTER 3: BASIC NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING

echo "=== CHAPTER 3: BASIC NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING ==="
echo "Now let's learn some basic network troubleshooting techniques."
echo ""

# Step 7: Ping a remote host
echo "Step 7: Let's test connectivity to a remote host using the 'ping' command. For example, to ping Google's DNS server, use: 'ping 8.8.8.8'."
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop the ping command."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "ping 8.8.8.8"
echo ""
echo "If you see replies, your network is working correctly. If not, there may be a connectivity issue."
echo ""

# Step 8: Trace the route to a remote host
echo "Step 8: Now let's trace the route to a remote host using the 'traceroute' command. For example, to trace the route to Google's DNS server, use: 'traceroute 8.8.8.8'."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "traceroute 8.8.8.8"
echo ""
echo "This command shows the path your traffic takes to reach the destination. Each hop represents a router or gateway along the way."
echo ""

# Step 9: Check DNS resolution
echo "Step 9: Finally, let's check DNS resolution using the 'nslookup' command. For example, to resolve 'google.com', use: 'nslookup google.com'."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "nslookup google.com"
echo ""
echo "This command shows the IP address associated with the domain name. If it fails, there may be a DNS issue."
