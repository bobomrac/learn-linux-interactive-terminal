# CHAPTER 1: BASIC NAVIGATION
echo "=== CHAPTER 1: BASIC NAVIGATION ==="
echo "Let's start by learning how to navigate the file system using the terminal."
echo ""

# Step 1: Check the current directory
echo "Step 1: Check the current directory."
echo "Use the 'pwd' command to print the current working directory."
echo "'pwd' stands for 'print working directory' and shows the full path of the directory you're currently in."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "pwd"
echo ""
echo "You are currently in your home directory, which is usually '/home/USERNAME'."
echo ""
read -p "Press Enter to continue."
echo ""

# Step 2: List files and directories
echo "Step 2: List files and directories."
echo "Use the 'ls' command to list the contents of the current directory."
echo "'ls' stands for 'list' and shows the files and directories in the current folder."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "ls"
echo ""
echo "This command displays the files and directories in your current location."
echo ""
read -p "Press Enter to continue."

# Step 3: Change to the Desktop directory
echo "Step 3: Change to the 'Desktop' directory."
echo "Use the 'cd' command to change directories. For example, to go to the 'Desktop' directory, use: 'cd Desktop'."
echo "'cd' stands for 'change directory' and allows you to move to a different folder."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "cd Desktop"
echo ""
echo "You are now in the 'Desktop' directory. You can verify this by running 'pwd' again."
echo ""
read -p "Press Enter to continue."
echo ""

# Step 4: Return to the home directory
echo "Step 4: Return to the home directory."
echo "There are several ways to return to your home directory:"
echo "1. 'cd ..' - Moves up one directory level."
echo "2. 'cd /home/USERNAME/' - Specifies the absolute path to your home directory."
echo "3. 'cd ~' - Always takes you to your home directory, no matter where you are."

# CHAPTER 2: LISTING FILES WITH OPTIONS

echo "=== CHAPTER 2: LISTING FILES WITH OPTIONS ==="
echo "Now let's explore some advanced options for the 'ls' command."
echo ""

# Step 5: List hidden files
echo "Step 5: List hidden files."
echo "Use the 'ls -a' command to list all files, including hidden ones."
echo "Hidden files in Linux start with a dot (.), such as '.bashrc'."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "ls -a"
echo ""
echo "You should now see hidden files in the output. These are often configuration files."
echo ""
read -p "Press Enter to continue."

# Step 6: List files with detailed information
echo "Step 6: List files with detailed information."
echo "Use the 'ls -l' command to list files with detailed information, such as permissions, ownership, size, and modification date."
echo "You can combine options like '-la' to show hidden files with detailed information."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "ls -la"
echo ""
echo "The output includes:"
echo "1. File permissions."
echo "2. Number of links."
echo "3. Owner and group."
echo "4. File size."
echo "5. Last modification date and time."
echo "6. File or directory name."

# CHAPTER 3: UNDERSTANDING FILE PERMISSIONS

echo "=== CHAPTER 3: UNDERSTANDING FILE PERMISSIONS ==="
echo "Now let's learn how to interpret file permissions in the 'ls -l' output."
echo ""

# Step 7: Interpret file permissions
echo "Step 7: Interpret file permissions."
echo "The first column in the 'ls -l' output shows file permissions. For example:"
echo "-rw-r--r--"
echo "This can be broken down as follows:"
echo "1. The first character indicates the file type ('-' for a regular file, 'd' for a directory)."
echo "2. The next three characters ('rw-') show the owner's permissions (read, write, execute)."
echo "3. The next three characters ('r--') show the group's permissions."
echo "4. The last three characters ('r--') show permissions for others."
echo ""
echo "Let's run 'ls -l' again to see the permissions."
echo ""
read -p "Write the command & press Enter: "
eval "ls -l"

echo "Take a moment to analyze the permissions for each file and directory."

# CHAPTER 4: USING THE MANUAL PAGES

echo "=== CHAPTER 4: USING THE MANUAL PAGES ==="
echo "Linux provides manual pages (man pages) for almost every command, which you can use to learn more about a command's options and usage."
echo ""

# Step 8: View the manual for 'ls'
echo "Step 8: View the manual for 'ls'."
echo "Use the 'man' command to view the manual page for a command. For example, to view the manual for 'ls', use: 'man ls'."
echo ""
